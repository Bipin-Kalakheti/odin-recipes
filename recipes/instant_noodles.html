<h2>Description:</h2>
<P> Instant noodles, also known as ramen noodles, are a type of pre-cooked and dried noodle block, usually made from wheat flour, water, salt, and other ingredients. They are called "instant" because they are designed to be cooked quickly and easily by simply boiling them in water for a few minutes. Once the noodles are cooked and the flavorings are added, they are ready to eat. Instant noodles are a popular convenience food worldwide due to their affordability, ease of preparation, and long shelf life. They are often enjoyed as a quick meal or snack, especially in college dorms, offices, and households where time or resources for cooking are limited.</P>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<P>For 1 Servings: </P>
<ul>
    <li>Noodle block (usually made from wheat flour, water, salt)</li>
    <li>Seasoning powder or flavoring packet</li>
    <li>Additional seasonings or garnishes (such as dried vegetables, dehydrated meat, or sesame seeds)</li>
    <li>water As required</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to Make Instant Noodles</h3>
<P><b> Step 1 Boil the water, all seasoning packets: </b> <br>
    Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add all the seasoning packets provided with the instant noodles into the boiling water. These seasoning packets typically contain flavorings such as salt, soy sauce, dehydrated vegetables, or spices, which will infuse the broth with flavor.</P>

<P> <b>Step 2 Drop in the noodles-Gently:</b> <br>
    Carefully add the noodles to the boiling water. Submerge them gently using a fork or chopsticks to ensure they cook evenly.</P>

<P><b> Step 3 Fan it(Optional):  </b> <br>
    After adding the noodles, begin to fan them gently. Fanning the noodles helps to slow down the cooking process, preventing them from becoming overly soft or soggy. The flow of air created by fanning cools the noodles slightly, allowing them to maintain a firmer texture while the broth continues to cook.</P>

<P><b> Step 4 Put an egg on it(Optional): </b> <br>
    crack an egg directly into the pot of boiling noodles and broth. The egg will poach in the hot liquid, adding richness and flavor to the dish. You can also cook the egg separately and add it to the noodles later, depending on your preference.</P>
